TODO: Save info box uses wrong colon for playtime. Are all colons used in GSC the tiny ones (No, Options menu uses the fat colons)?

TODO: Save info box updates playtime because I am forced to reshow it between Yes/No boxes.
Save playtime in variable and rewrite function to use it?

TODO: Right-facing arrow cursor (used in start menu, Yes/No boxes, etc.) turns white in Crystal when A is pressed to select something.
Need to replicate this behavior.

TODO: Update Options menu selections to Crystal equivalents when flags are figured out. Make the Menu Account option actually work for the start menu.

TODO: Black out the Options menu background; and decide if SGB borders are a thing and implement them.

TODO: Remove National Dex requirement for trading with FRLG, replace with Time Capsule check.

TODO: Fix other Metal Advance players appearing as Emerald players in link rooms.

TODO: When flags are settled, make wild encounters depend on a version check instead of being random.

TODO: Remove the early return in src/fldeff_teleport.c in function SetUpFieldMove_Teleport(). It was changed to allow Teleport anywhere for debugging purposes.

TODO: In Crystal, wild Pokemon can be encountered on the pink exit tiles in Ilex Forest. Need to replicate that.

TODO: Fix water palettes on all tilesets.

TODO: Get Flash working in the field and make cave exits flicker in dark caves.

TODO: Move the camera 8 pixels to the right.

TODO: Set up the specific Unown encounters in the Ruins of Alph based on flags.

TODO: The period character in the Pokegear's Time Card textbox isn't spaced correctly. It is too close to the "t" in "exit".

TODO: Snorlax and presumably the other big dolls are not aligned correctly on the tile grid.
